aLogcat is the well-known developer tool logcat, in the form of an Android application.

View color-coded, scrolling (tailed) Android device (logcat) logs directly from your phone. No USB, adb, or emailing necessary.

Set log format / level / buffer, filter logs by regex, clear log file, save to SD.

Share logs via any application that handles plain text or HTML sharing, including  Gmail, Email, Pastedroid, Bluetooth, and others.

Install application Pastedroid to share logs via pastebin. Ensure HTML output is disabled in preferences as this only supports plain text logs.

Optionally save log files at specified intervals in the background.
